            <p> Greetings! I'm Sarah, a second-year Industrial Engineering major at Oregon State University, with minors
                in Biology and Psychology. Beyond academics, I've honed skills in communication, customer relations, and
                business through my retail experience. But my journey doesn't end there. Committed to community
                engagement and meaningful change, I'm deeply involved in outreach and diversity initiatives. My
                portfolio reflects a fusion of engineering expertise, diverse experiences, and a drive for positive
                impact. Welcome!
            </p>
